# This is just a place holder

This is my lean and clean [neovim](https://neovim.io) editor setup.

# Plugins

Plugins are managed with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),
which is automatically downloaded at the first run of `nvim`.

To install all the plugins you will need to execute a `:PlugInstall`.
